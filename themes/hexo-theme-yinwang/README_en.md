## Introduction

Project motivation: "[Blog theme sharing plan (draft)](https://smallyu-net.translate.goog/2021/02/11/%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E4%B8%BB%E9%A2%98%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)》

Style design comes from: [https://www.yinwang.org](http://www.yinwang.org/)

Theme style demo: [https://www.smallyu.net](https://www.smallyu.net/)

## Templates

Since the installation steps of the theme are cumbersome, in order to use this theme more easily, here is a template site that has been configured with the theme, which can be downloaded and used directly. The template site is initialized with the latest hexo, without any extra modification except the necessary configuration.

Template address: [https://github.com/smallunet/hexo-theme-yinwang-demo](https://github.com/smallunet/hexo-theme-yinwang-demo)

Added support for templates:
   - Latex rendering
   - Tag cloud page
   - Category pages
   - about page

## Install

The install step is **required**.

1. Enter the blog project directory
     - If you have already created a blog project, go directly to the directory
     - If you have not created a blog project, execute `hexo init blog` to initialize the project, enter the `blog` directory, and execute `npm i`

2. Copy the theme to the `themes` directory of the blog project

3. Execute the following command to install the necessary dependencies

```
npm i --save hexo-renderer-pug
npm i --save hexo-wordcount-sy
```

4. `_config.yml` file configuration of the blog project
     - Change the value of `theme` to `hexo-theme-yinwang`
     - Modify the value of `enable` under `highlight` to `false`
     - Change the value of `subtitle` to the title of your blog

5. The theme's `_config.yml` file configuration
     - No need to change, here is a reminder to distinguish it from the configuration file of the project

6. Run `hexo clean && hexo server` to start the preview

## Bookmark page

Run the command to create a new page:

```
hexo new page tags
```

Open the file `source/tags/index.md`, add `type: tags` in the front-matter of the file header, after adding it looks like this:

```
---
title: tag cloud
date: 2022-08-30 18:07:20
type: tags
---
```

`title` can be freely changed to the desired title content.

## illustrate

1. The function of `type: tags` is to identify the current page as a tab page. Currently, `tags`, `categories`, `about`, and `display` are supported. These are theme-defined content, which are not included in the hexo documentation

2. About theme configuration
     - The path of the icon is under the `source` folder of the project (not the source of the theme), directly put `favicon.svg` into `source`
     - Some styles are configurable, such as article titles

3. About the demo site
     - The content of micro-blog is hard-coded, and there is no way to provide a convenient way to use it
     - Theme should have been stripped of superfluous personal content

4. If you have any questions or find any problems during the use of the theme, please discuss in issue or pr

## Formula rendering

You can use this hexo plugin: [https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-filter-mathjax](https://github.com/next-theme/hexo-filter-mathjax). No additional support is required at the topic level.
